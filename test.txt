As a deployment engineer, you are the tip of the spear. You will lead the implementation of our robots in logistics warehouses. You will need to be a fast learner & independent thinker who can work with our engineering and go-to-market teams to make our customers happy and successful. You naturally build alliances and can seamlessly integrate with other people: the customer will see you as a trusted teammate, and the engineering and development teams will view your input as the “Ground Truth”. The ideal candidate will be able to grow with the company and take on additional leadership roles over time. You will have a variety of responsibilities across physical deployment and integration, customer support, and new product development and launch. This is an exciting opportunity to have a real impact on the development of our fast-growing fleet of robots deployed in logistics warehouses across the United States. Fluency in Spanish is a big plus as it helps us interact with some of our warehouse associate stakeholders.Key Activities:Deploy and install automation solutions, including industrial robot arms, software, and auxiliary hardware.Support product testing and launch by working with product management and engineering teams on understanding customer needs, developing test instrumentation, executing testing, and analyzing results.Write documentation on product operating and testing procedures.Support manufacturing and engineering design with Design for Deployment and Design for Reliability feedback and data analysis from the field.Provide on-call technical support to customers post-deployment.Conduct on-site integration and test activities and evaluate post go-live performance metrics.Introduce and walk through new features with customers directly for timely feedback to software and hardware teams at Pickle HQ for iterative, responsive product development.Be the primary field point of contact for customers. Be ready and willing to do whatever it takes to keep customers happy and build trust with them in their own native processes, so they see Pickle as valued fellow team member and not just a contractor.Help facilitate not only engineering interactions but also support sales and marketing efforts as the front-facing Pickle point of contact to customers while on-site.Execute field retrofits.
